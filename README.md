# Resource Tool

My old source code of the resource tool, written in C++, for the game **Fantasy Tennis**.    
It decrypts `.set` files which are located inside the `.res` archives. It also encrypts the plain file again to the `.set` file.

#### Usage
To decrypt a `.set` file, just drag and drop it on the compiled application.    
To encrypt it back after changes has been made, drag and drop the decrypted file on the compiled application.

#### Software needed
**Visual Studio 15** or later.
